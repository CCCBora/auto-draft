"Title: Playing Atari game using De-Centralized PPO 
Contributions: The main contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) We propose a novel adaptation of PPO for de-centralized multi-agent Atari gameplay, building upon the existing PPO framework (Wijmans et al.,2020). (2) We provide a comprehensive evaluation of our decentralized PPO approach, comparing its performance to state-of-the-art centralized methods in the Atari domain. (3) We identify key factors influencing the performance of decentralized PPO in Atari games and provide insights into potential avenues for future research in decentralized DRL."
