\section{experiments}

In this section, we present the experimental setup and results of our proposed Decentralized Atari Learning (DAL) algorithm. We begin with a high-level overview of the experimental design, followed by a detailed description of the evaluation metrics, baselines, and the Atari games used for evaluation. Finally, we present the results of our experiments, including comparisons with state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized RL methods, and discuss the insights gained from our analysis.

\subsection{Experimental Design}

Our experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of the DAL algorithm in terms of scalability, privacy, and convergence in multi-agent Atari environments. We compare our method with state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized RL approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of high-dimensional sensory input and complex decision-making processes. The experimental setup consists of the following main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluation Metrics: We use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of our algorithm: cumulative reward, training time, and communication overhead.
    \item Baselines: We compare our method with state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized RL approaches, including DQN \citep{mnih2013playing}, A3C \citep{mnih2016asynchronous}, and Dec-PG \citep{lu2021decentralized}.
    \item Atari Games: We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse set of Atari games, including Breakout, Pong, Space Invaders, and Ms. Pac-Man, to demonstrate its generalizability and robustness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We use the following evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our proposed DAL algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cumulative Reward:} The total reward accumulated by the agents during an episode, which serves as a measure of the agents' performance in the Atari games.
    \item \textbf{Training Time:} The time taken by the agents to learn their policies, which serves as a measure of the algorithm's scalability and efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Communication Overhead:} The amount of information exchanged between the agents during the learning process, which serves as a measure of the algorithm's privacy and communication efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Baselines}

We compare the performance of our proposed DAL algorithm with the following state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized RL methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DQN} \citep{mnih2013playing}: A centralized deep Q-learning algorithm that learns to play Atari games directly from raw pixel inputs.
    \item \textbf{A3C} \citep{mnih2016asynchronous}: A centralized actor-critic algorithm that combines the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods for continuous control tasks and Atari games.
    \item \textbf{Dec-PG} \citep{lu2021decentralized}: A decentralized policy gradient algorithm that accounts for coupled safety constraints in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Atari Games}

We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse set of Atari games, including the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Breakout:} A single-player game in which the agent controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.
    \item \textbf{Pong:} A two-player game in which the agents control paddles to bounce a ball and score points by passing the ball past the opponent's paddle.
    \item \textbf{Space Invaders:} A single-player game in which the agent controls a spaceship to shoot down invading aliens while avoiding their projectiles.
    \item \textbf{Ms. Pac-Man:} A single-player game in which the agent controls Ms. Pac-Man to eat pellets and avoid ghosts in a maze.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

We present the results of our experiments in Table \ref{tab:results} and Figures \ref{exp1}, \ref{exp2}, and \ref{exp3}. Our proposed DAL algorithm demonstrates competitive performance compared to the centralized and decentralized baselines in terms of cumulative reward, training time, and communication overhead.

Our analysis reveals that the DAL algorithm achieves competitive performance in terms of cumulative reward, outperforming the decentralized Dec-PG method and maintaining comparable performance with the centralized DQN and A3C methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm in addressing the challenges of high-dimensional sensory input and complex decision-making processes in Atari games.

In terms of training time and communication overhead, the DAL algorithm shows significant improvements over the centralized methods, highlighting its scalability and privacy-preserving capabilities. The algorithm also outperforms the Dec-PG method in these aspects, demonstrating the benefits of our novel communication mechanism.

In summary, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Decentralized Atari Learning (DAL) algorithm in playing Atari games using decentralized reinforcement learning. The algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized RL methods while maintaining scalability, privacy, and convergence in multi-agent Atari environments.
