INFO:utils.gpt_interaction:\section{Introduction}

The rapid development of artificial intelligence and machine learning has led to significant advancements in various domains, including reinforcement learning (RL) and multi-agent systems. One particularly notable application of RL is in the domain of Atari games, where deep learning models have been successfully employed to learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input \citep{mnih2013playing}. However, the centralized nature of traditional RL algorithms poses challenges in terms of scalability and privacy, motivating the exploration of decentralized RL approaches \citep{liu2022federated}. In this paper, we address the problem of playing Atari games using decentralized reinforcement learning, aiming to develop a scalable and privacy-preserving solution that maintains high performance.

Our proposed solution builds upon recent advancements in decentralized RL, which have demonstrated promising results in various scenarios, such as collision avoidance \citep{thumiger2022a}, cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning \citep{su2022ma2ql}, and edge-computing-empowered Internet of Things (IoT) networks \citep{lei2022adaptive}. While these works provide valuable insights, our approach specifically targets the unique challenges associated with playing Atari games, such as high-dimensional sensory input and complex decision-making processes. By leveraging the strengths of decentralized RL algorithms, we aim to outperform centralized approaches in terms of scalability and privacy while maintaining competitive performance.

This paper makes three novel contributions to the field of decentralized reinforcement learning. First, we present a new decentralized RL algorithm specifically tailored for playing Atari games, addressing the challenges of high-dimensional sensory input and complex decision-making. Second, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm's performance, comparing it to state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized RL approaches on a diverse set of Atari games. Finally, we offer insights into the trade-offs between scalability, privacy, and performance in decentralized RL, highlighting the benefits and limitations of our proposed approach.

To contextualize our work, we briefly discuss key related works in the field of decentralized RL. The Safe Dec-PG algorithm, proposed by \citet{lu2021decentralized}, is the first decentralized policy gradient method that accounts for coupled safety constraints in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Another relevant work is the decentralized collision avoidance approach by \citet{thumiger2022a}, which employs a unique architecture incorporating long-short term memory cells and a gradient-based reward function. While these works demonstrate the potential of decentralized RL, our approach specifically targets the challenges associated with playing Atari games, offering a novel solution in this domain.

In summary, this paper presents a novel decentralized RL algorithm for playing Atari games, aiming to achieve high performance while maintaining scalability and privacy. By building upon recent advancements in decentralized RL, we contribute to the growing body of research in this area, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between scalability, privacy, and performance in decentralized reinforcement learning.

\paragraph{Deep Reinforcement Learning for Atari Games}
The seminal work by \citet{mnih2013playing} introduced the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. This model outperformed all previous approaches on six of the games and surpassed a human expert on three of them. The authors later extended their work with asynchronous gradient descent for optimization of deep neural network controllers, showing success on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems and a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input \citep{mnih2016asynchronous}. However, these approaches suffer from overestimations in value function approximations, which were addressed by \citet{hasselt2015deep} through a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm, leading to much better performance on several games.

\paragraph{Decentralized Reinforcement Learning}
Decentralized reinforcement learning has been studied in various contexts. \citet{lu2021decentralized} proposed a decentralized policy gradient (PG) method, Safe Dec-PG, to perform policy optimization based on the D-CMDP model over a network. This was the first decentralized PG algorithm that accounted for coupled safety constraints with a quantifiable convergence rate in multi-agent reinforcement learning. \citet{lei2022adaptive} introduced an adaptive stochastic incremental ADMM (asI-ADMM) algorithm for decentralized RL with edge-computing-empowered IoT networks, showing better performance in terms of communication costs and scalability compared to the state of the art. However, the work by \citet{lyu2021contrasting} highlighted misconceptions regarding centralized critics in the literature, emphasizing that both centralized and decentralized critics have different pros and cons that should be considered by algorithm designers.

\paragraph{Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning}
Game theory has been widely used in combination with reinforcement learning to tackle multi-agent problems. \citet{yin2022air} proposed an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning and game theory to solve Nash equilibrium strategy in highly competitive environments, demonstrating good convergence through simulation tests. \citet{adams2020resolving} addressed the challenges of implicit coordination in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning by combining Deep-Q Networks for policy learning with Nash equilibrium for action selection. In the context of autonomous driving, \citet{duan2022autonomous} proposed an automatic drive model based on game theory and reinforcement learning, enabling multi-agent cooperative driving with strategic reasoning and negotiation in traffic scenarios. However, these approaches often require complex computations and may not scale well to large-scale problems.

\paragraph{Decentralized Learning with Communication Constraints}
One of the challenges in decentralized learning is to handle communication constraints. \citet{kong2021consensus} showed that decentralized training converges as fast as the centralized counterpart when the training consensus distance is lower than a critical quantity, providing insights for designing better decentralized training schemes. \citet{fu2022automatic} proposed a decentralized ensemble learning framework for automatic modulation classification, reducing communication overhead while maintaining similar classification performance. In the context of multi-agent systems, \citet{su2022ma2ql} introduced MA2QL, a minimalist approach to fully decentralized cooperative MARL with theoretical guarantees on convergence to a Nash equilibrium when each agent achieves $\varepsilon$-convergence at each turn. However, these methods may still suffer from limitations in highly dynamic and complex environments.

\paragraph{Decentralized Collision Avoidance}
Decentralized collision avoidance has been an important application of reinforcement learning. \citet{thumiger2022a} proposed an improved deep reinforcement learning controller for decentralized collision avoidance using a unique architecture incorporating long-short term memory cells and a reward function inspired by gradient-based approaches. This controller outperformed existing techniques in environments with variable numbers of agents. In the context of autonomous vehicles, \citet{ardekani2022combining} suggested a novel algorithm based on Nash equilibrium and memory neural networks for path selection in highly dynamic and complex environments, showing that the obtained response matched with Nash equilibrium in 90.2 percent of the situations during simulation experiments. However, these approaches may require extensive training and computational resources, which could be a concern in real-world applications.

INFO:utils.gpt_interaction:\section{Backgrounds}

The central problem in the field of decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop efficient algorithms that can learn optimal policies in multi-agent environments while addressing the challenges of scalability, privacy, and convergence. This problem is of great importance in various industrial applications, such as autonomous vehicles \citep{duan2022autonomous}, traffic signal control \citep{yang2021an}, and edge-computing-empowered Internet of Things (IoT) networks \citep{lei2022adaptive}. Theoretical challenges in this field include the design of algorithms that can handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, non-stationarity, and the exponential growth of state-action space \citep{adams2020resolving}.

\subsection{Foundational Concepts and Notations}

Reinforcement learning is a framework for learning optimal policies through interaction with an environment \citep{sutton2005reinforcement}. In this framework, an agent takes actions in an environment to achieve a goal, and the environment provides feedback in the form of rewards. The objective of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.

A standard RL problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma)$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is the state space, $\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, $\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ is the state transition probability function, $\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the reward function, and $\gamma \in [0, 1)$ is the discount factor. The agent's goal is to learn a policy $\pi: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, defined as $V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_t | S_0 = s, \pi\right]$.

In decentralized RL, multiple agents interact with the environment and each other to learn optimal policies. The problem can be modeled as a Decentralized Markov Decision Process (D-MDP) \citep{lu2021decentralized}, which extends the MDP framework to include multiple agents and their local observations, actions, and policies. The D-MDP is defined by a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}_1, \dots, \mathcal{A}_n, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}_1, \dots, \mathcal{R}_n, \gamma)$, where $n$ is the number of agents, $\mathcal{A}_i$ is the action space of agent $i$, and $\mathcal{R}_i$ is the reward function of agent $i$. Each agent aims to learn a local policy $\pi_i: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}_i$ that maximizes its expected cumulative reward.

\subsection{Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}

Decentralized RL algorithms can be broadly categorized into two classes: value-based and policy-based methods. Value-based methods, such as decentralized Q-learning \citep{hasselt2015deep}, aim to learn an action-value function $Q^\pi(s, a)$, which represents the expected cumulative reward of taking action $a$ in state $s$ and following policy $\pi$ thereafter. The optimal policy can be derived from the optimal action-value function, $Q^*(s, a) = \max_\pi Q^\pi(s, a)$, as $\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a Q^*(s, a)$. Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) \citep{mnih2013playing} extend Q-learning to high-dimensional state spaces by using deep neural networks to approximate the action-value function.

Policy-based methods, such as decentralized policy gradient (Dec-PG) \citep{lu2021decentralized}, directly optimize the policy by following the gradient of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the policy parameters. Actor-critic algorithms \citep{lillicrap2015continuous} combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods by using a critic to estimate the action-value function and an actor to update the policy based on the critic's estimates. Decentralized actor-critic algorithms have been proposed for continuous control tasks \citep{mnih2016asynchronous} and multi-agent collision avoidance \citep{thumiger2022a}.

In this paper, we focus on the application of decentralized RL algorithms to the problem of playing Atari games. We build upon the foundational concepts and algorithms introduced above and develop a novel decentralized RL algorithm that addresses the challenges of scalability, privacy, and convergence in multi-agent Atari environments.

\subsection{Decentralized Learning in Atari Environments}

Atari games provide a challenging testbed for RL algorithms due to their high-dimensional state spaces, diverse game dynamics, and complex scoring systems \citep{mnih2013playing}. Recent advances in deep RL have led to the development of algorithms that can learn to play Atari games directly from raw pixel inputs, outperforming human experts in some cases \citep{mnih2013playing}. However, most of these algorithms are centralized and do not scale well to large multi-agent environments.

In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized RL algorithm for playing Atari games that leverages the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods. Our algorithm builds upon the decentralized Q-learning and Dec-PG frameworks and incorporates techniques from deep RL, such as experience replay \citep{mnih2013playing} and target networks \citep{hasselt2015deep}, to improve stability and convergence. We also introduce a novel communication mechanism that allows agents to share information and coordinate their actions while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to centralized methods and outperforms existing decentralized RL algorithms in the Atari domain.

\subsection{Formulation of the Decentralized Atari Learning Algorithm}

The DAL algorithm is designed to overcome the weaknesses of existing decentralized RL methods by incorporating techniques from deep RL, such as experience replay and target networks, to improve stability and convergence. The algorithm consists of the following main steps:

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Decentralized Atari Learning (DAL)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Initialize the decentralized Q-network $Q(s, a; \theta)$ and the target network $Q(s, a; \theta^-)$ with random weights $\theta$ and $\theta^-$.
\FOR{each agent $i$}
    \STATE Initialize the experience replay buffer $D_i$.
    \FOR{each episode}
        \STATE Initialize the state $s$.
        \FOR{each time step $t$}
            \STATE Agent $i$ selects an action $a$ according to its local policy $\pi_i$ and the decentralized Q-network $Q(s, a; \theta)$.
            \STATE Agent $i$ takes action $a$, observes the next state $s'$ and reward $r$, and stores the transition $(s, a, r, s')$ in its experience replay buffer $D_i$.
            \STATE Agent $i$ samples a mini-batch of transitions from $D_i$ and computes the target values $y = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta^-)$.
            \STATE Agent $i$ updates the decentralized Q-network $Q(s, a; \theta)$ using the policy gradient-based optimization technique.
            \STATE Agent $i$ updates the target network $Q(s, a; \theta^-)$ with the weights of the decentralized Q-network $Q(s, a; \theta)$.
            \STATE Agent $i$ communicates with neighboring agents to share information and coordinate actions while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead.
            \STATE Update the state $s \leftarrow s'$.
        \ENDFOR
    \ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Key Concepts and Novelty of the Decentralized Atari Learning Algorithm}

The novelty of the DAL algorithm lies in its combination of value-based and policy-based decentralized RL techniques, as well as its unique communication mechanism that enables agents to share information and coordinate their actions while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead. In this subsection, we elaborate on these key concepts using formulas and figures.

\paragraph{Decentralized Q-learning and Policy Gradient Optimization}

The DAL algorithm builds upon the decentralized Q-learning framework and incorporates a policy gradient-based optimization technique to balance the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. The decentralized Q-network $Q(s, a; \theta)$ is used to estimate the action-value function, while the policy gradient-based optimization technique is employed to update the network weights $\theta$. This combination allows the algorithm to learn more efficiently in high-dimensional state spaces and complex decision-making processes, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig2}.

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig2.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the decentralized Q-learning and policy gradient optimization in the DAL algorithm.}
  \label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Novel Communication Mechanism}

The communication mechanism in DAL enables agents to share information and coordinate their actions while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead. This is achieved through a secure and efficient communication protocol that allows agents to exchange only the necessary information for coordination, without revealing their entire state or action history. Figure \ref{fig3} provides an illustration of the communication mechanism in the DAL algorithm.

This model outperformed all previous approaches on six of the games and surpassed a human expert on three of them. The authors later extended their work with asynchronous gradient descent for optimization of deep neural network controllers, showing success on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems and a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input \\citep{mnih2016asynchronous}. However, these approaches suffer from overestimations in value function approximations, which were addressed by \\citet{hasselt2015deep} through a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm, leading to much better performance on several games.\n\n\\paragraph{Decentralized Reinforcement Learning}\nDecentralized reinforcement learning has been studied in various contexts. \\citet{lu2021decentralized} proposed a decentralized policy gradient (PG) method, Safe Dec-PG, to perform policy optimization based on the D-CMDP model over a network. This was the first decentralized PG algorithm that accounted for coupled safety constraints with a quantifiable convergence rate in multi-agent reinforcement learning. \\citet{lei2022adaptive} introduced an adaptive stochastic incremental ADMM (asI-ADMM) algorithm for decentralized RL with edge-computing-empowered IoT networks, showing better performance in terms of communication costs and scalability compared to the state of the art. However, the work by \\citet{lyu2021contrasting} highlighted misconceptions regarding centralized critics in the literature, emphasizing that both centralized and decentralized critics have different pros and cons that should be considered by algorithm designers.\n\n\\paragraph{Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning}\nGame theory has been widely used in combination with reinforcement learning to tackle multi-agent problems. \\citet{yin2022air} proposed an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning and game theory to solve Nash equilibrium strategy in highly competitive environments, demonstrating good convergence through simulation tests. \\citet{adams2020resolving} addressed the challenges of implicit coordination in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning by combining Deep-Q Networks for policy learning with Nash equilibrium for action selection. In the context of autonomous driving, \\citet{duan2022autonomous} proposed an automatic drive model based on game theory and reinforcement learning, enabling multi-agent cooperative driving with strategic reasoning and negotiation in traffic scenarios. However, these approaches often require complex computations and may not scale well to large-scale problems.\n\n\\paragraph{Decentralized Learning with Communication Constraints}\nOne of the challenges in decentralized learning is to handle communication constraints. \\citet{kong2021consensus} showed that decentralized training converges as fast as the centralized counterpart when the training consensus distance is lower than a critical quantity, providing insights for designing better decentralized training schemes. \\citet{fu2022automatic} proposed a decentralized ensemble learning framework for automatic modulation classification, reducing communication overhead while maintaining similar classification performance. In the context of multi-agent systems, \\citet{su2022ma2ql} introduced MA2QL, a minimalist approach to fully decentralized cooperative MARL with theoretical guarantees on convergence to a Nash equilibrium when each agent achieves $\\varepsilon$-convergence at each turn. However, these methods may still suffer from limitations in highly dynamic and complex environments.\n\n\\paragraph{Decentralized Collision Avoidance}\nDecentralized collision avoidance has been an important application of reinforcement learning. \\citet{thumiger2022a} proposed an improved deep reinforcement learning controller for decentralized collision avoidance using a unique architecture incorporating long-short term memory cells and a reward function inspired by gradient-based approaches. This controller outperformed existing techniques in environments with variable numbers of agents. In the context of autonomous vehicles, \\citet{ardekani2022combining} suggested a novel algorithm based on Nash equilibrium and memory neural networks for path selection in highly dynamic and complex environments, showing that the obtained response matched with Nash equilibrium in 90.2 percent of the situations during simulation experiments. However, these approaches may require extensive training and computational resources, which could be a concern in real-world applications.', 'backgrounds': "\\section{Backgrounds}\n\nThe central problem in the field of decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop efficient algorithms that can learn optimal policies in multi-agent environments while addressing the challenges of scalability, privacy, and convergence. This problem is of great importance in various industrial applications, such as autonomous vehicles \\citep{duan2022autonomous}, traffic signal control \\citep{yang2021an}, and edge-computing-empowered Internet of Things (IoT) networks \\citep{lei2022adaptive}. Theoretical challenges in this field include the design of algorithms that can handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, non-stationarity, and the exponential growth of state-action space \\citep{adams2020resolving}.\n\n\\subsection{Foundational Concepts and Notations}\n\nReinforcement learning is a framework for learning optimal policies through interaction with an environment \\citep{sutton2005reinforcement}. In this framework, an agent takes actions in an environment to achieve a goal, and the environment provides feedback in the form of rewards. The objective of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.\n\nA standard RL problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by a tuple $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{R}, \\gamma)$, where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the state space, $\\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, $\\mathcal{P}: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\times \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ is the state transition probability function, $\\mathcal{R}: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the reward function, and $\\gamma \\in [0, 1)$ is the discount factor. The agent's goal is to learn a policy $\\pi: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, defined as $V^\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t R_t | S_0 = s, \\pi\\right]$.\n\nIn decentralized RL, multiple agents interact with the environment and each other to learn optimal policies. The problem can be modeled as a Decentralized Markov Decision Process (D-MDP) \\citep{lu2021decentralized}, which extends the MDP framework to include multiple agents and their local observations, actions, and policies. The D-MDP is defined by a tuple $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{A}_n, \\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{R}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{R}_n, \\gamma)$, where $n$ is the number of agents, $\\mathcal{A}_i$ is the action space of agent $i$, and $\\mathcal{R}_i$ is the reward function of agent $i$. Each agent aims to learn a local policy $\\pi_i: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_i$ that maximizes its expected cumulative reward.\n\n\\subsection{Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}\n\nDecentralized RL algorithms can be broadly categorized into two classes: value-based and policy-based methods. Value-based methods, such as decentralized Q-learning \\citep{hasselt2015deep}, aim to learn an action-value function $Q^\\pi(s, a)$, which represents the expected cumulative reward of taking action $a$ in state $s$ and following policy $\\pi$ thereafter. The optimal policy can be derived from the optimal action-value function, $Q^*(s, a) = \\max_\\pi Q^\\pi(s, a)$, as $\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a Q^*(s, a)$. Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) \\citep{mnih2013playing} extend Q-learning to high-dimensional state spaces by using deep neural networks to approximate the action-value function.\n\nPolicy-based methods, such as decentralized policy gradient (Dec-PG) \\citep{lu2021decentralized}, directly optimize the policy by following the gradient of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the policy parameters. Actor-critic algorithms \\citep{lillicrap2015continuous} combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods by using a critic to estimate the action-value function and an actor to update the policy based on the critic's estimates. Decentralized actor-critic algorithms have been proposed for continuous control tasks \\citep{mnih2016asynchronous} and multi-agent collision avoidance \\citep{thumiger2022a}.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the application of decentralized RL algorithms to the problem of playing Atari games. We build upon the foundational concepts and algorithms introduced above and develop a novel decentralized RL algorithm that addresses the challenges of scalability, privacy, and convergence in multi-agent Atari environments.\n\n\\subsection{Decentralized Learning in Atari Environments}\n\nAtari games provide a challenging testbed for RL algorithms due to their high-dimensional state spaces, diverse game dynamics, and complex scoring systems \\citep{mnih2013playing}. Recent advances in deep RL have led to the development of algorithms that can learn to play Atari games directly from raw pixel inputs, outperforming human experts in some cases \\citep{mnih2013playing}. However, most of these algorithms are centralized and do not scale well to large multi-agent environments.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel decentralized RL algorithm for playing Atari games that leverages the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods.

This problem is of great importance in various industrial applications, such as autonomous vehicles \\citep{duan2022autonomous}, traffic signal control \\citep{yang2021an}, and edge-computing-empowered Internet of Things (IoT) networks \\citep{lei2022adaptive}. Theoretical challenges in this field include the design of algorithms that can handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, non-stationarity, and the exponential growth of state-action space \\citep{adams2020resolving}.\n\n\\subsection{Foundational Concepts and Notations}\n\nReinforcement learning is a framework for learning optimal policies through interaction with an environment \\citep{sutton2005reinforcement}. In this framework, an agent takes actions in an environment to achieve a goal, and the environment provides feedback in the form of rewards. The objective of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.\n\nA standard RL problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by a tuple $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{R}, \\gamma)$, where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the state space, $\\mathcal{A}$ is the action space, $\\mathcal{P}: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\times \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ is the state transition probability function, $\\mathcal{R}: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the reward function, and $\\gamma \\in [0, 1)$ is the discount factor. The agent's goal is to learn a policy $\\pi: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, defined as $V^\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t R_t | S_0 = s, \\pi\\right]$.\n\nIn decentralized RL, multiple agents interact with the environment and each other to learn optimal policies. The problem can be modeled as a Decentralized Markov Decision Process (D-MDP) \\citep{lu2021decentralized}, which extends the MDP framework to include multiple agents and their local observations, actions, and policies. The D-MDP is defined by a tuple $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{A}_n, \\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{R}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{R}_n, \\gamma)$, where $n$ is the number of agents, $\\mathcal{A}_i$ is the action space of agent $i$, and $\\mathcal{R}_i$ is the reward function of agent $i$. Each agent aims to learn a local policy $\\pi_i: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_i$ that maximizes its expected cumulative reward.\n\n\\subsection{Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}\n\nDecentralized RL algorithms can be broadly categorized into two classes: value-based and policy-based methods. Value-based methods, such as decentralized Q-learning \\citep{hasselt2015deep}, aim to learn an action-value function $Q^\\pi(s, a)$, which represents the expected cumulative reward of taking action $a$ in state $s$ and following policy $\\pi$ thereafter. The optimal policy can be derived from the optimal action-value function, $Q^*(s, a) = \\max_\\pi Q^\\pi(s, a)$, as $\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a Q^*(s, a)$. Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) \\citep{mnih2013playing} extend Q-learning to high-dimensional state spaces by using deep neural networks to approximate the action-value function.\n\nPolicy-based methods, such as decentralized policy gradient (Dec-PG) \\citep{lu2021decentralized}, directly optimize the policy by following the gradient of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the policy parameters. Actor-critic algorithms \\citep{lillicrap2015continuous} combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods by using a critic to estimate the action-value function and an actor to update the policy based on the critic's estimates. Decentralized actor-critic algorithms have been proposed for continuous control tasks \\citep{mnih2016asynchronous} and multi-agent collision avoidance \\citep{thumiger2022a}.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the application of decentralized RL algorithms to the problem of playing Atari games.

Recent advances in deep RL have led to the development of algorithms that can learn to play Atari games directly from raw pixel inputs, outperforming human experts in some cases \\citep{mnih2013playing}. However, most of these algorithms are centralized and do not scale well to large multi-agent environments.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel decentralized RL algorithm for playing Atari games that leverages the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods. Our algorithm builds upon the decentralized Q-learning and Dec-PG frameworks and incorporates techniques from deep RL, such as experience replay \\citep{mnih2013playing} and target networks \\citep{hasselt2015deep}, to improve stability and convergence.

The D-MDP is defined by a tuple $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{A}_n, \\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{R}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{R}_n, \\gamma)$, where $n$ is the number of agents, $\\mathcal{A}_i$ is the action space of agent $i$, and $\\mathcal{R}_i$ is the reward function of agent $i$. Each agent aims to learn a local policy $\\pi_i: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_i$ that maximizes its expected cumulative reward.\n\n\\subsection{Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}\n\nDecentralized RL algorithms can be broadly categorized into two classes: value-based and policy-based methods. Value-based methods, such as decentralized Q-learning \\citep{hasselt2015deep}, aim to learn an action-value function $Q^\\pi(s, a)$, which represents the expected cumulative reward of taking action $a$ in state $s$ and following policy $\\pi$ thereafter. The optimal policy can be derived from the optimal action-value function, $Q^*(s, a) = \\max_\\pi Q^\\pi(s, a)$, as $\\pi^*(s) = \\arg\\max_a Q^*(s, a)$. Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) \\citep{mnih2013playing} extend Q-learning to high-dimensional state spaces by using deep neural networks to approximate the action-value function.\n\nPolicy-based methods, such as decentralized policy gradient (Dec-PG) \\citep{lu2021decentralized}, directly optimize the policy by following the gradient of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the policy parameters. Actor-critic algorithms \\citep{lillicrap2015continuous} combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods by using a critic to estimate the action-value function and an actor to update the policy based on the critic's estimates. Decentralized actor-critic algorithms have been proposed for continuous control tasks \\citep{mnih2016asynchronous} and multi-agent collision avoidance \\citep{thumiger2022a}.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the application of decentralized RL algorithms to the problem of playing Atari games. We build upon the foundational concepts and algorithms introduced above and develop a novel decentralized RL algorithm that addresses the challenges of scalability, privacy, and convergence in multi-agent Atari environments.\n\n\\subsection{Decentralized Learning in Atari Environments}\n\nAtari games provide a challenging testbed for RL algorithms due to their high-dimensional state spaces, diverse game dynamics, and complex scoring systems \\citep{mnih2013playing}. Recent advances in deep RL have led to the development of algorithms that can learn to play Atari games directly from raw pixel inputs, outperforming human experts in some cases \\citep{mnih2013playing}. However, most of these algorithms are centralized and do not scale well to large multi-agent environments.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel decentralized RL algorithm for playing Atari games that leverages the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods. Our algorithm builds upon the decentralized Q-learning and Dec-PG frameworks and incorporates techniques from deep RL, such as experience replay \\citep{mnih2013playing} and target networks \\citep{hasselt2015deep}, to improve stability and convergence. We also introduce a novel communication mechanism that allows agents to share information and coordinate their actions while preserving privacy and reducing communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to centralized methods and outperforms existing decentralized RL algorithms in the Atari domain.", 'methodology': "\\section{methodology}\n\nIn this section, we present the methodology of our proposed decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for playing Atari games.
