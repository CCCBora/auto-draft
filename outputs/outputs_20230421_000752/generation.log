This work\nproposes a temporal dissimilarity measure for temporal network comparison based\non the fastest arrival distance distribution and spectral entropy based\nJensen-Shannon divergence. Experimental results on both synthetic and empirical\ntemporal networks show that the proposed measure could discriminate diverse\ntemporal networks with different structures by capturing various topological\nand temporal properties.

However, the propagation mechanisms of EEG in the human brain and\nits intrinsic correlation with emotions are still obscure to researchers. This\nwork proposes four variant transformer frameworks~(spatial attention, temporal\nattention, sequential spatial-temporal attention and simultaneous\nspatial-temporal attention) for EEG emotion recognition to explore the\nrelationship between emotion and spatial-temporal EEG features. Specifically,\nspatial attention and temporal attention are to learn the topological structure\ninformation and time-varying EEG characteristics for emotion recognition\nrespectively. Sequential spatial-temporal attention does the spatial attention\nwithin a one-second segment and temporal attention within one sample\nsequentially to explore the influence degree of emotional stimulation on EEG\nsignals of diverse EEG electrodes in the same temporal segment. The\nsimultaneous spatial-temporal attention, whose spatial and temporal attention\nare performed simultaneously, is used to model the relationship between\ndifferent spatial features in different time segments. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that simultaneous spatial-temporal attention leads to the best\nemotion recognition accuracy among the design choices, indicating modeling the\ncorrelation of spatial and temporal features of EEG signals is significant to\nemotion recognition.\n', '2007.04828': '  Links in most real networks often change over time. Such temporality of links\nencodes the ordering and causality of interactions between nodes and has a\nprofound effect on network dynamics and function. Empirical evidences have\nshown that the temporal nature of links in many real-world networks is not\nrandom. Nonetheless, it is challenging to predict temporal link patterns while\nconsidering the entanglement between topological and temporal link patterns.\nHere we propose an entropy-rate based framework, based on combined\ntopological-temporal regularities, for quantifying the predictability of any\ntemporal network. We apply our framework on various model networks,\ndemonstrating that it indeed captures the intrinsic topological-temporal\nregularities whereas previous methods considered only temporal aspects. We also\napply our framework on 18 real networks of different types and determine their\npredictability. Interestingly, we find that for most real temporal networks,\ndespite the greater complexity of predictability brought by the increase in\ndimension the combined topological-temporal predictability is higher than the\ntemporal predictability. Our results demonstrate the necessity of incorporating\nboth temporal and topological aspects of networks in order to improve\npredictions of dynamical processes.\n'}

INFO:utils.gpt_interaction:Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a significant research area in the field of artificial intelligence, with a wide range of applications in robotics, finance, healthcare, and gaming \cite{2108.11510}. The primary goal of RL is to develop algorithms that allow agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with their environment, maximizing the cumulative reward over time \cite{1708.05866}. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, RL still faces several challenges, such as the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, the curse of dimensionality, and the need for efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale and complex problems \cite{1906.10025}.

One of the major breakthroughs in RL has been the development of Q-learning algorithms, which have been proven to converge to the optimal solution \cite{2303.08631}. However, Q-learning is known to suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal performance and slow convergence in some cases \cite{2106.14642}. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various modifications and extensions to Q-learning, such as Double Q-learning \cite{1511.02377} and Self-correcting Q-learning \cite{2012.01100}, which aim to mitigate the overestimation bias while maintaining convergence guarantees.

Another essential aspect of RL research is the incorporation of deep learning techniques, giving rise to the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) \cite{1709.05067}. DRL has demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, such as playing video games directly from pixels and learning control policies for robots \cite{1708.05866}. However, DRL algorithms often require a large amount of data and computational resources, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios \cite{1906.10025}. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed various approaches, including distributed DRL \cite{2212.00253} and expert-guided DRL \cite{2106.14642}, which aim to improve the sample efficiency and scalability of DRL algorithms.

Related work in the field of RL has also focused on the development of policy gradient methods, which optimize the policy directly by following the gradient of the expected return \cite{1811.09013}. These methods have been particularly successful in continuous action settings and have led to the development of algorithms such as Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \cite{2209.01820}. However, policy gradient methods often require on-policy data, which can be inefficient in terms of sample complexity \cite{1911.04817}.

In summary, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of Reinforcement Learning, focusing on the challenges and recent advances in Q-learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and policy gradient methods. By examining the key algorithms, techniques, and applications in these areas, we hope to shed light on the current limitations and future research directions in the field of RL.

INFO:utils.gpt_interaction:\paragraph{Markov Decision Processes:}
The study of reinforcement learning is fundamentally rooted in the understanding of Markov decision processes (MDPs). A concise description of stochastic approximation algorithms in reinforcement learning of MDPs is provided by \cite{1512.07669}. The work done in \cite{1511.02377} offers a full characterization of the set of value functions of MDPs, while \cite{1512.09075} specifies a notation for MDPs. The concept of decisiveness in denumerable Markov chains has been extended to MDPs in \cite{2008.10426}, exploring the implications of resolving non-determinism in adversarial or cooperative ways. Additionally, \cite{0711.2185} introduces an embedding technique to produce a finite-state MDP from a countable-state MDP, which can be used as an approximation for computational purposes.

\paragraph{Q-Learning and Variants:}
Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm that converges to the optimal solution \cite{2303.08631}. However, it is known to overestimate values and spend too much time exploring unhelpful states. Double Q-learning, a convergent alternative, mitigates some of these overestimation issues but may lead to slower convergence \cite{2303.08631}. To address the maximization bias in Q-learning, \cite{2012.01100} introduces a self-correcting algorithm that balances the overestimation of conventional Q-learning and the underestimation of Double Q-learning. This self-correcting Q-learning algorithm is shown to be more accurate and achieves faster convergence in certain domains.

\paragraph{Expert Q-Learning:}
Expert Q-learning is a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm proposed in \cite{2106.14642}. Inspired by Dueling Q-learning, it incorporates semi-supervised learning into reinforcement learning by splitting Q-values into state values and action advantages. An expert network is designed in addition to the Q-network, which updates each time following the regular offline minibatch update. The algorithm is demonstrated to be more resistant to overestimation bias and achieves more robust performance compared to the baseline Q-learning algorithm.

\paragraph{Policy Gradient Methods:}
Policy gradient methods are widely used for control in reinforcement learning, particularly in continuous action settings. Natural gradients have been extensively studied within the context of natural gradient actor-critic algorithms and deterministic policy gradients \cite{2209.01820}. The work in \cite{1811.09013} presents the first off-policy policy gradient theorem using emphatic weightings and develops a new actor-critic algorithm called Actor Critic with Emphatic weightings (ACE) that approximates the simplified gradients provided by the theorem. This algorithm is shown to outperform previous off-policy policy gradient methods, such as OffPAC and DPG, in finding the optimal solution.

\paragraph{Deep Reinforcement Learning:}
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combines the power of deep learning with reinforcement learning, achieving remarkable success in various domains, such as finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and computer vision \cite{2108.11510}. The field has seen significant advancements in recent years, with central algorithms such as the deep Q-network, trust region policy optimization, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic being developed \cite{1708.05866}. A detailed review of DRL algorithms and their theoretical justifications, practical limitations, and empirical properties can be found in \cite{1906.10025}.

\paragraph{Temporal Networks:}
Temporal networks, where links change over time, are essential in understanding the ordering and causality of interactions between nodes in various applications. The work in \cite{2111.01334} proposes a temporal dissimilarity measure for temporal network comparison based on the fastest arrival distance distribution and spectral entropy-based Jensen-Shannon divergence. This measure is shown to effectively discriminate diverse temporal networks with different structures and functional distinctions.

In conclusion, reinforcement learning has seen significant advancements in recent years, with various algorithms and techniques being developed to address the challenges in the field. From understanding the fundamentals of MDPs to developing advanced DRL algorithms, researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in reinforcement learning and its applications.

INFO:utils.gpt_interaction:\subsection{Problem Statement and Foundational Concepts}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward signal. In RL, an agent interacts with an environment through a sequence of actions, observations, and rewards, aiming to learn an optimal policy that maps states to actions \cite{1512.09075}. The problem can be formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is defined by a tuple $(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$, where $S$ is the set of states, $A$ is the set of actions, $P$ is the state transition probability function, $R$ is the reward function, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor \cite{1511.02377}. The goal of RL is to find a policy $\pi(a|s)$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, defined as $G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$, where $R_{t+k+1}$ is the reward received at time step $t+k+1$ \cite{1512.07669}.

\subsection{Q-Learning and Related Algorithms}

Q-learning is a popular model-free RL algorithm that estimates the action-value function $Q(s, a)$, which represents the expected cumulative reward of taking action $a$ in state $s$ and following the optimal policy thereafter \cite{2303.08631}. The Q-learning update rule is given by:

\[Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ R(s, a) + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right],\]

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, $R(s, a)$ is the reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$, and $s'$ is the next state \cite{2303.08631}. However, Q-learning can suffer from overestimation bias, which can lead to suboptimal performance \cite{2106.14642}. To address this issue, Double Q-learning was proposed, which uses two separate Q-value estimators and updates them alternately, mitigating overestimation bias while maintaining convergence guarantees \cite{2303.08631}. Another variant, Expert Q-learning, incorporates semi-supervised learning by splitting Q-values into state values and action advantages, and using an expert network to assess the value of states \cite{2106.14642}.

\subsection{Policy Gradient Methods}

Policy gradient methods are another class of RL algorithms that optimize the policy directly by estimating the gradient of the expected cumulative reward with respect to the policy parameters \cite{1703.02102}. The policy gradient theorem provides a simplified form for the gradient, which can be used to derive on-policy and off-policy algorithms \cite{1811.09013}. Natural policy gradients, which incorporate second-order information to improve convergence, form the foundation for state-of-the-art algorithms like Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \cite{2209.01820}.

\subsection{Methodology and Evaluation Metrics}

In this paper, we will explore various RL algorithms, focusing on Q-learning and its variants, as well as policy gradient methods. We will delve into their theoretical foundations, convergence properties, and practical limitations. To assess the performance of these algorithms, we will use evaluation metrics such as cumulative reward, convergence speed, and sample efficiency. By comparing the performance of different algorithms, we aim to provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses, and identify potential areas for improvement and future research directions.
